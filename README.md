<p>This project applies data science principles to the high-stakes world of Formula 1, demonstrating a full pipeline from data ingestion and cleaning to predictive modeling, simulation, and business-focused recommendations. The final result is an interactive Streamlit dashboard that finds the optimal pit stop strategy for any given F1 race.

<h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>In Formula 1, race strategy is a multi-million dollar decision made under extreme pressure. This project addresses the core business problem of identifying the fastest possible strategy from thousands of combinations.
The solution is a Python-based application that models the performance of a key depreciating assetâ€”the tyres. By analyzing practice session data, the model predicts tyre wear, simulates every viable one-stop and two-stop strategy, and provides a clear, data-driven recommendation for the optimal approach. When validated against the 2025 Monza Grand Prix, the model's predicted optimal race time was within 2 second of the actual winning time, demonstrating its high accuracy and business value.</p>
